                    <h3>Will GreenTrade buy my broken phone?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. We are so committed to the environment that we want to dispose of your broken phone properly and will pay you to give us the honor to do so. Such an honor is not paid for at the same price of a functioning cellphone. The condition of the phone is a large factor in the price we will pay for the phone but we will even buy broken phones.</p>
