                <p>Get the best value for your phone based on model and condition. Once you agree with our fair value offer for your unwanted phone you can arrange to get the phone picked up. It's like having a personal chauffeur for your phone! (now that is service). Once we receive your phone in our warehouse we inspect the phone to ensure the condition is as you said it was and ba-da-boom we issue you a payment quicker than swiping right!</p>
